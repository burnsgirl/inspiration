Most of the leaves covered the ground and you know the snow will be here soon enough. The lake was so peaceful and quiet. The leaves were falling nonstop as if racing to see who could hit the ground fastest. Even at the waterfall the leaves were swarming to the rushing water.",

        "content": "Today I got up at 3am and drove 2 1/2 hrs to the Blue Ridge Parkway. My goal, to see the sunrise. After contemplating on where to go, I ended up choosing Rough Ridge. The reason being is because you can get a lot of phenomenal 360 views of the parkway from there and to get to the first spot it's not too far of a hike. The weather that day was a bit rougher than I thought it was going to be. It was about 40 degrees and there were super strong, heavy winds that wouldn't stop. Needless to say, it was very cold but I wasn't going to let that stop me.",
