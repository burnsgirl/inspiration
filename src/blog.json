        "content": "Today I got up at 3am and drove 2 1/2 hrs to the Blue Ridge Parkway. My goal, to see the sunrise. After contemplating on where to go, I ended up choosing Rough Ridge. The reason being is because you can get a lot of phenomenal 360 views of the parkway from there and to get to the first spot it's not too far of a hike. The weather that day was a bit rougher than I thought it was going to be. It was about 40 degrees and there were super strong, heavy winds that wouldn't stop. Needless to say, it was very cold but I wasn't going to let that stop me.",
